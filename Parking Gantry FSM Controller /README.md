The aim of this lab was to design a finite state machine capable of detecting cars entering and exiting a 
car park with a total capacity of 15. Once this was achieved, the following step was to target the PYNQ
Z2 FPGA board and modify the design of the modules to use the buttons and LEDs featured on the board.

The outcome of the lab was as intended, a FSM capable of detecting the entry and exit of car into a 
carpark was achieved. In addition, the design had the capability to detect if a car were to reverse in the 
case that it didnâ€™t fully enter the carpark.
